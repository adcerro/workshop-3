 * Workshop 3: Counting Duplicates in a Plain Text File (cases)
 *
 * Synopsis:
 * Analisys of best, worst and average cases for a previous algorithm that finds
 * the number of duplicates in plain text files storing N random integers
 * each integer within a specified range, the amount of duplicates of each number is stored
 * in an array, using 16 samples to make a graphic for each case, the result of a sample is stored
 * in a file called times.txt that will be used to plot the data gathered for comparison

/*
 * COMMENTS:
 *
 * Reading Data:
 * Reads integers until the scanner object finds something that it is not
 * an integer, such as a String or an End-Of-File EOF for instance.
 *
 * Static methods:
 * Static methods are not bound to any object of the class and these can
 * be conveniently invoked directly from the main program (as done here).
 *
 * Variables:
 * Note that local variables are destroyed (freed from memory) after the
 * method executes. Do not use global variables unless you really have to.
